Depending on the offer, you may be required to first activate the offer by following the instructions provided before you make the purchase to receive the Bonus Points or receive the reward. Your online, phone or in-store Qualifying Order must be completed during the stated time-period and must be completed with the email address associated with your Pizza Profile.</li><li><strong>No Cash Value or Transferability.</strong> Points do not constitute property, do not entitle a member a vested right or interest and have no cash value.

Sponsor will not provide any refunds once Points are redeemed.</li><li><strong>Promotional Offers:</strong>From time to time, Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, elect to offer promotional opportunities for Participants to redeem Points in addition to the ability to redeem Points for the Menu Items as set forth above. These promotional offers may only be available for a limited time period, may offer promotional points with pre-set expiration dates and may be limited to select store locations. Sponsor will provide the specific terms and conditions of any promotional offers at such time.</li></ol></li><li><h3>Inactivity and Forfeiture</h3><ol><li>If a Participant fails to either earn or redeem Points for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive calendar days, the Participant will forfeit any Points remaining in his/her Pizza Profile, without compensation.</li></ol></li><li><h3>General Terms and Conditions</h3><ol><li>Sponsor reserves the right to suspend or discontinue the eligibility of any person who uses, or, in the case of suspension, is suspected of using, the Program in a manner inconsistent with these Rules or any federal or state laws, statutes or ordinances. In addition to suspension or discontinuance of the Program eligibility, Sponsor shall have the right to take appropriate administrative and/or legal action, including criminal prosecution, as it deems necessary in its sole discretion.</li><li>Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the Program may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Sponsor's failure to enforce any of these Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that, or any other, provision.</li><li>All questions or disputes regarding eligibility for the Program, accumulation of and redemption of Points, or a Participant's compliance with these Rules will be resolved by Sponsor in its sole discretion.</li><li>Sponsor is not responsible for any incorrect or inaccurate information supplied by Participants while participating in the Program.</li><li>Participants are responsible for the payment of all taxes which may result from participation in the Program.</li><li>Participants are responsible for maintaining updated contact information in their Pizza Profile.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, therefore such exclusions may not apply to you. If sponsor improperly denies a participant any reward, liability will be limited to the equivalent fair market value of the reward. By participating in the program, a participant waives any and all rights to bring any claim or action related to such matters in any forum beyond one (1) year after the first occurrence of the kind of act, event, condition or omission upon which the claim or action is based.</span></li><li>As a condition of participating in the Program, Participant agrees that, except where prohibited, any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of, or connected with, the Program or any item purchased therein shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, and exclusively by the appropriate court located in Michigan. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, Participant's rights and obligations, or the rights and obligations of Sponsor in connection with the Program, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Michigan, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the State of Michigan or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than State of Michigan.</li><li>If any provision of these Rules is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed from the remainder of these Rules, which will otherwise remain in full force and effect.</li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>Sponsored by:</strong> Domino's National Advertising Fund Inc., 30 Frank Lloyd Wright Drive, Ann Arbor MI 48106.</p><p>These Program terms were updated as of September 11, 2023.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="__reakit-portal"><div hidden="" data-dialog-ref="saved-cart-modal" class="css-6xf871 e5ve8sy1" style="display: none;"><div id="saved-cart-modal" hidden="" role="dialog" tabindex="-1" aria-modal="true" data-dialog="true" aria-label="We saved your cart" data-quid="saved-cart-modal" aria-labelledby="saved-cart-modal-header" class="css-1dtobqt e5ve8sy2" style="display: none;"><h1 id="saved-cart-modal-header" class="css-w7h1be e5ve8sy3">We saved your cart</h1><button type="button" aria-label="Close" class=" css-1uitr56" data-dpz-track-evt-name="Close" data-quid="close-button-component"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 12.09 12.08" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M11.84.26a.86.86 0 0 1 .25.61.9.9 0 0 1-.25.62L7.28 6.05l4.56 4.56a.89.89 0 0 1 .25.62.86.86 0 0 1-.25.61.89.89 0 0 1-1.23 0L6.05 7.28l-4.56 4.56a.89.89 0 0 1-1.23 0 .87.87 0 0 1 0-1.23l4.56-4.56L.26 1.49A.87.87 0 0 1 0 .87.83.83 0 0 1 .26.26a.87.87 0 0 1 1.23 0l4.56 4.56L10.61.26a.87.87 0 0 1 1.23 0z" fill="#000000"></path></svg></button><div class="css-156yyvm e5ve8sy0"><div class="css-vf2lks"><p class="message">Pick up where you left off.
